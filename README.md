# Perler

Here's all my perler samples.


## Making Source Images

  I use gimp to trim down sprites to be perfectly small and 1:1 pixel scaling and ensure the image is 16 pixels wide (or a reasonable multiple of that).  Sometimes I have to add whitespace to make the source image 16 pixels wide.

  Then for printing, I scale the image up using Gimp:
    > Set the interpolation method to 'none'
    > Ensure x/y axis are locked
    > Set the width to 224, which is (16pixel x 14scaling)

In rare cases, your printer won't print the correctly sized image.  To prove that your printer is printing things to the correct size, simply try to use the template with a perler set and you'll notice that the printout doesn't line up with the perler pegs.  If this is the case, simply adjust your target image width until you have it close enough to work with.  During this trial and error phase, I recommend sticking to multiples of 4 so Gimp doesn't mess up your image by applying interpolation incorrectly.
